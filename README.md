# 2odin-recipes

# 1 - Introduction:

Hello everyone, this is my first ever project using github and VsCode.
The project is based on creating a site that offers a bunch of recipes that you can try at home.
In this project, I will be working with html mainly to practice all the parts that I uncovered in the course. (tag elements etc..)
